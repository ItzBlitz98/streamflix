## Install (manual)

Clone the repository:

```
git clone git@github.com:ItzBlitz98/streamflix.git
```


Install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

You can now run the executable in the bin directory.

## Subtitles
Streamflix can fetch subtitles automagically for you, Subtitles can be enabled from the config.yaml file. Just set subtitles to true.

I can't guarantee that the subtitles will match but in my limited testing they were spot on.
